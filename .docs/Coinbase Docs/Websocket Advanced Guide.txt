2. Common Integration Issues and Troubleshooting

When integrating with Coinbase Advanced Trade WebSockets, developers may encounter issues such as disconnections, dropped messages, and rate limits. This section provides practical solutions to these common challenges.
Connection and Disconnection Problems

WebSocket connections can be interrupted for various reasons, including network instability, server restarts, or idle timeouts. Handling these disconnections gracefully is crucial for ensuring seamless data flow in your application.
Handling Disconnects and Reconnects

To handle disconnections:

    Implement an event listener for the on_close event in your WebSocket client.
    Attempt to reconnect with an exponential backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the server with connection attempts.
    Resubscribe to all necessary channels upon reconnection.

Example: Reconnecting After Disconnection (Python)

import websocket
import time

def on_close(ws):
    print("Connection closed. Reconnecting...")
    reconnect(ws)

def reconnect(ws):
    time.sleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds before reconnecting
    ws.run_forever()

# Add this to your WebSocketApp to handle reconnections
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com", on_close=on_close)
ws.run_forever()

Subscription Timeout (5 Seconds)

To avoid connection termination, you must send a valid subscription message within 5 seconds of opening a WebSocket connection. If no message is sent within this time, the server will disconnect you.

Best Practice: Ensure your WebSocket client immediately sends a subscription message upon connection.

def on_open(ws):
    # Send subscription message upon connection
    subscribe_message = {
        "type": "subscribe",
        "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
        "channel": "ticker"
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))

Using Heartbeats to Prevent Idle Timeouts

WebSocket connections may be closed if there are no updates from subscribed channels, particularly for illiquid trading pairs. To prevent this, subscribe to the heartbeats channel to receive periodic messages that keep the connection alive.

subscribe_message = {
    "type": "subscribe",
    "channel": "heartbeats"
}

The heartbeats channel sends a message every second, ensuring the connection remains open even during periods of low activity.
Dropped or Out-of-Order Messages

Due to the nature of WebSocket connections, some messages might be dropped or arrive out of order, especially in high-volume trading environments.

Monitoring and Handling Sequence Numbers

Each message in the WebSocket stream contains a sequence number. Sequence numbers increase by one with each new message. If you detect a gap in the sequence numbers, it indicates that a message was dropped.

If sequence numbers arrive out of order, they can usually be ignored, but gaps in sequence numbers should prompt a resync of your order book or real-time data.

Best Practice: Implement logic to detect gaps in sequence numbers and trigger resynchronization of your data feed when necessary.

def on_message(ws, message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    # Check for sequence gaps
    if "sequence_num" in data:
        current_sequence = data["sequence_num"]
        if current_sequence > last_sequence + 1:
            print(f"Gap detected. Resync required. Last: {last_sequence}, Current: {current_sequence}")
            # Trigger resync logic here
        last_sequence = current_sequence

Resynchronizing the Order Book

If gaps are detected, you may need to resubscribe to the level2 channel and request a fresh snapshot of the order book to ensure consistency.
Rate Limiting

Coinbase Advanced Trade WebSockets enforce rate limits to ensure fair usage. Exceeding these limits may result in temporary disconnections or throttling.

Rate Limits Overview

    Authenticated connections: Rate-limited at 750 messages per second per IP.
    Unauthenticated connections: Rate-limited at 8 messages per second per IP.

Best Practices for Handling Rate Limits:

    Avoid sending unnecessary messages or frequent reconnections.
    Spread out your subscriptions across multiple WebSocket connections if you're monitoring multiple products or high-volume channels.
    Use batch channels (like ticker_batch) instead of individual channels where possible to reduce message volume.

Example: Using Ticker Batch Channel

subscribe_message = {
    "type": "subscribe",
    "product_ids": ["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"],
    "channel": "ticker_batch"
}

The ticker_batch channel sends price updates every 5 seconds instead of immediately, reducing the total number of messages and helping you stay within rate limits.
3. Best Practices for WebSocket Performance

Ensuring optimal WebSocket performance is critical for applications that depend on real-time data from the Coinbase Developer Platform's Advanced Trade product. This section outlines best practices for optimizing WebSocket connections, managing high-volume channels, and implementing a reliable failover strategy.
Optimizing WebSocket Connections

For applications handling high-frequency data, optimizing the WebSocket connection can greatly improve performance and reliability.

    Buffer Size Management WebSocket clients often receive a high volume of data, especially when subscribing to channels like level2 or market_trades. To prevent data loss or dropped messages, it’s important to configure the largest possible receive buffer size for your WebSocket client.

Best Practice: Increase the buffer size based on your system's capabilities and the expected volume of data. For example, in Python's socket library, you can adjust the buffer size via the setsockopt method:

import socket
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com")

# Adjust buffer size
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_RCVBUF, 1048576) # 1MB buffer

Ensure that your client library supports buffer size adjustments and configure it to handle large bursts of incoming messages.

    Using Batch Channels to Reduce Message Traffic

For products like ticker, subscribing to the ticker_batch channel instead of the ticker channel reduces message traffic by batching updates at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds). This reduces bandwidth usage and ensures that your WebSocket connection remains efficient, particularly for high-volume products.

Example: Subscribing to Ticker Batch Channel:

subscribe_message = {
    "type": "subscribe",
    "product_ids": ["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"],
    "channel": "ticker_batch"
}
ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))

The ticker_batch channel provides the same information as ticker but in a more bandwidth-friendly format, making it ideal for applications that don’t need updates for every trade.
Handling High-Volume Channels

Some channels, such as level2 and market_trades, provide detailed, high-frequency updates that can overwhelm a WebSocket connection if not handled properly. The following strategies will help manage these high-volume channels effectively.
Managing Data from level2 and market_trades Channels

The level2 channel provides order book updates, while the market_trades channel delivers trade data. Both of these can generate a significant amount of traffic during periods of high market activity.

Best Practice: Implement message batching or aggregation in your client to reduce the load. Rather than processing every message immediately, group messages into batches before updating your local state.

Example: Implementing Message Batching

import json

message_buffer = []

def on_message(ws, message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    message_buffer.append(data)

    # Process batch of 100 messages
    if len(message_buffer) >= 100:
        process_messages(message_buffer)
        message_buffer.clear()

def process_messages(messages):
    # Aggregate or process the batch of messages here
    print(f"Processing {len(messages)} messages")

This approach reduces the processing overhead and network strain by handling multiple messages at once.
Failover Strategy

Ensuring continuity in WebSocket connections is essential, especially for critical trading systems. Coinbase provides two WebSocket endpoints—advanced-trade-ws for public data and advanced-trade-ws-user for authenticated user data. You can design a failover mechanism by connecting to both endpoints and switching to the secondary WebSocket connection in the event of a failure.

Setting Up Primary and Failover WebSocket Connections

When connecting to user-specific data using advanced-trade-ws-user, it’s best to use advanced-trade-ws as a backup for public data to maintain availability during potential downtime.

Example: WebSocket Failover Strategy

primary_url = "wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com"
failover_url = "wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com"

def connect_ws(url):
    return websocket.WebSocketApp(url, on_message=on_message, on_close=on_close)

def on_close(ws):
    print(f"Connection closed. Switching to failover...")
    failover_ws = connect_ws(failover_url)
    failover_ws.run_forever()

# Start with the primary WebSocket connection
ws = connect_ws(primary_url)
ws.run_forever()

In this failover setup, if the primary connection (advanced-trade-ws-user) fails, the client will automatically switch to the secondary connection (advanced-trade-ws). This ensures that market data continues to be received even if the primary WebSocket is temporarily unavailable.
4. Advanced WebSocket Features

In addition to market data, Coinbase's Advanced Trade WebSockets offer advanced features like the user channel for monitoring order and account data in real-time, and the futures_balance_summary channel for managing futures balances and margin requirements. These features are especially useful for applications that require user-specific information and futures trading insights.
User Channel

The user channel provides real-time updates on a user's open orders, order status changes, and any modifications made to their account. This channel is particularly useful for tracking open positions, managing active orders, and responding to changes in order status (e.g., when an order is filled, canceled, or rejected).
Subscribing to and Managing Order Updates

To subscribe to the user channel, you must authenticate using a JWT and specify the product IDs you're interested in. This subscription will stream real-time updates related to your orders and account.

Example: Subscribing to the User Channel

import websocket
import json

def on_open(ws):
    # Example JWT (replace with actual JWT token)
    jwt_token = generate_jwt()

    # Subscribe to the user channel for BTC-USD orders
    subscribe_message = {
        "type": "subscribe",
        "channel": "user",
        "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
        "jwt": jwt_token
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))
    print("Subscribed to user channel for BTC-USD orders")

# Set up WebSocket connection (similar to previous examples)
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com", on_open=on_open)
ws.run_forever()

Once subscribed, you'll receive updates on all of your open orders, including status changes (e.g., open, filled, canceled).

Example Use Cases for Tracking Positions and Order Statuses

    Real-Time Order Monitoring: The user channel allows developers to build interfaces that provide up-to-the-second updates on order status (e.g., if an order is partially filled or canceled).
    Order Management Systems: Applications can use this channel to automatically adjust active positions based on real-time updates, such as closing an order or modifying the order book in response to execution events.

Sample Order Update Message:

{
  "channel": "user",
  "sequence_num": 123456,
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "update",
      "order_id": "abc123",
      "status": "FILLED",
      "filled_value": "500.00",
      "filled_size": "0.05",
      "remaining_size": "0"
    }
  ]
}

In this example, the message indicates that an order has been fully filled, and your system could update the user interface or trigger automated workflows based on this event.
Futures Balance Summary

For users engaged in futures trading, the futures_balance_summary channel provides real-time updates on their futures balances, margin requirements, and position details. This channel is crucial for monitoring margin levels and ensuring that traders have sufficient collateral to support their positions.
Monitoring Futures Balances and Margin Requirements

The futures_balance_summary channel provides detailed information about the user's buying power, margin requirements, unrealized profits and losses (PnL), and liquidation thresholds. This data is essential for traders to understand their risk exposure and for automated systems to make margin-related decisions.

Example: Subscribing to the Futures Balance Summary Channel

import websocket
import json

def on_open(ws):
    # Example JWT (replace with actual JWT token)
    jwt_token = generate_jwt()

    # Subscribe to the futures_balance_summary channel
    subscribe_message = {
        "type": "subscribe",
        "channel": "futures_balance_summary",
        "jwt": jwt_token
    }
    ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))
    print("Subscribed to futures_balance_summary channel")

# Set up WebSocket connection
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com", on_open=on_open)
ws.run_forever()

Real-Time Futures Position Updates

Once subscribed, the futures_balance_summary channel streams real-time updates about the user’s futures balance. This includes details like total buying power, unrealized PnL, margin requirements, and liquidation thresholds.

Sample Futures Balance Summary Message:

{
  "channel": "futures_balance_summary",
  "sequence_num": 78910,
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "snapshot",
      "fcm_balance_summary": {
        "futures_buying_power": "5000.00",
        "total_usd_balance": "10000.00",
        "unrealized_pnl": "-100.00",
        "initial_margin": "2000.00",
        "available_margin": "3000.00",
        "liquidation_threshold": "1500.00"
      }
    }
  ]
}

In this message, the user's futures buying power, margin, and unrealized PnL are provided. Applications can use this information to:

    Monitor Margin Levels: Automatically alert users if they are nearing their liquidation threshold.
    Manage Risk: Implement logic to adjust trading strategies or trigger margin calls based on real-time balance updates.

By utilizing the advanced features of the user and futures_balance_summary channels, developers can build powerful tools for managing user orders and futures positions in real-time. These features allow for granular tracking of account activity, ensuring that users can make informed decisions and stay ahead of market changes.
